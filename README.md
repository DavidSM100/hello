# Hello

Sample project with a simple implementation of the webxdc read and write APIs.

## Demo (no server or installation required)

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click 'Add Peer' to open as many peers as you like
3. Type a message and press 'Send' to see the update in each peer. (For Safari you might need to check the setting under Develop > Disable Local File Restrictions.)

## Developing webxdc apps

Simply copy `webxdc.js` from this repo beside your `index.html` and you are ready to go.

Bundle your app using `./create-xdc.sh your-app-name`
and send it to your friends ðŸ™‚

*Note: the API is still under development and
this is just a proof-of-concept for now.*

### Type-checking and completion

If you are using VSCode you can have autocompletion and type-checking even without using TypeScript by adding these two lines to your JavaScript source files:

```js
//@ts-check
/** @typedef {import('./webxdc').Webxdc} Webxdc */
```

Without VSCode you need to install TypeScript and then run the check manually.

```sh
npm -g typescript
tsc --noEmit --allowJs --lib es2015,dom webxdc.js # to check if types and simulator are in sync
tsc --noEmit --allowJs --lib es2015,dom your_js_file.js
```

### Developing in Safari

To use the devtool in safari you need to disable the local file restrictions
under `Develop` -> `Disable Local File Restrictions`.

After doing this you can use the dev tool simulator.

Make sure to reload (`Cmd + R`) all simulator tabs/windows to apply this setting.
Without this option `Add Peer` seems to work (it opens a new instance), but **the instances will not be able to communicate**.

### Developing on Android

TODO - turn notes into a nice guide

- install Termux
- install python & git in termux (or is it preinstalled??)
- git clone the devtool repo or your fork of it
- use `python -m http.server` (TODO check complete syntax) to serve it for development and use nano / vim
- when your done use the packaging script
- and then copy the file to a location from where you can access and send it via deltachat.

- pro tip: you can create symbolic link to a folder in the external storage


## limitations

due to the nature of most browsers and how they scope `localStorage`,
each emulated peer will get the same `localStorage`.

to really test the storage usage of your Webxdc,
bundle the app and test it in Delta Chat directly
where all peers get their own `localStorage`.
